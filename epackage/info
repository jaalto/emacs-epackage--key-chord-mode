Description: map pairs of simultaneously pressed keys to commands
 A global minor mode to intercept A "key chord", two keys pressed
 simultaneously, or a single key quickly pressed twice. Use
 `key-chord-describe' to list defined chords. It is only possible to
 records chords in ASCII range 32..126. It is not possible to define key
 chords involving function keys, control keys, or non-english letter
 .
 Tip: Choose two keys that are close to each other on the keyboard, so they
 can be quickly typed without effort. Chords involving two hands (as
 opposed to two fingers on one hand) are harder to type (quickly).
 .
 Note: key chords longer that 2 keys are not implemented.
 .
 Examples:
 .
  (key-chord-define-global ",,"     "\C-a")
  (key-chord-define-global ".."     "\C-e")
  ;; Insert dollar sign e.g. in European keybard where it's cubersome
  ;; Right-AltGr-4 combination
  (key-chord-define-global "r4"     "$")
 .
 Note: 2013-09-08 the code hasn't been updated since 2008.
